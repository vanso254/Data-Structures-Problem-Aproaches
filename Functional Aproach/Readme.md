**Functional programming** in Python refers to a programming paradigm where you build your programs using pure functions and avoid mutable data structures whenever possible. It emphasizes immutability, higher-order functions, and the use of functions as first-class citizens.

When it comes to data structures, functional programming in Python often involves using immutable data structures like tuples, namedtuples, frozensets, and frozendicts. These data structures cannot be changed after they are created, which aligns with the principle of immutability in functional programming.
