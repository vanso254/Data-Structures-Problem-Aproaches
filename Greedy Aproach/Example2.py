# The Interval Scheduling Maximization problem involves selecting the maximum number of non-overlapping intervals from a given set of intervals. Each interval has a start time and an end time. The goal is to choose the largest possible subset of intervals such that 
# no two intervals overlap.

# Example Use Case
# Imagine you are a conference room scheduler. You have several requests for booking the room,
#  each with a specific start and end time. Your task is to maximize the number of bookings 
#  that can be accommodated without any overlap.
